# message_filter
This algorithm filters text messages and classifies them as either business or personal. It is based off a Naive Bayes frequency analysis algorithm, with modifications specific to the nature of text messages. It calculates accuracy, precision, and recall as numbers to evaluate its performance, where positives are business and negatives are personal. It is trained on a set of 4000 messages and is shown to have 95% accuracy when tested on 1000 new ones.
